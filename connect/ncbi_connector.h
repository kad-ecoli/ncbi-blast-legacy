 *   and handle connection("CONN", see also in "ncbi_connection.[ch]") to an
 *   abstract I/O service. This is generally not for the public use.
 *   It is to be used in the modules that implement a particular connector.

 * the same as those for their counterparts "CONN_***" in ncbi_connection.h.
 * First argument of these functions accepts a real connector handle
 * rather than a connection handle("CONN").
 * In every call, which has STimeout as an argument, this argument
 * can be either NULL, CONN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, or other non-NULL pointer,
 * pointing to finite timeout structure. NULL is treated as an infinite
 * timeout, while CONN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT means to use any timeout, which
 * is somehow pre-defined by the connector itself.
