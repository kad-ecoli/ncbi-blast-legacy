/* Create an iterator for sequential server lookup.
 * Connection information 'net_info' can be a NULL pointer, which means not to
 * make any network connections (only LOCAL/LBSMD mappers will be consulted).
 * If 'net_info' is not NULL, LOCAL/LBSMD are consulted first, and then DISPD
 * is consulted last (using the connection information provided) but only if
 * mapping with LOCAL/LBSMD (if any occurred) has failed.  Registry
 * section [CONN], keys LOCAL_DISABLE, LBSMD_DISABLE, and DISPD_DISABLE
 * (which can be overridden from the environment variables CONN_LOCAL_DISABLE,
 * CONN_LBSMD_DISABLE, and CONN_DISPD_DISABLE, respectively) can be used to
 * skip respective service mappers.  This scheme permits to use any
 * combination of the service mappers (local/lbsmd/network-based).
 * Note that if 'net_info' is not NULL then non-zero value of
 * 'net_info->stateless' forces 'types' to have the 'fSERV_StatelessOnly'
 * bit set implicitly.
 * NB: 'nbo' in comments denotes parameters coming in network byte order;
 *     'hbo' stands for 'host byte order'.

 * found both in registry and environment variables (here the implicit

 * ConnNetInfo_Create(service), and then automatically used).
